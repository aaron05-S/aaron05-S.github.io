### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was interesting for me because coding a function to say "Hello World" was something I had never done before. I was curious about learning about the different git commands and functions used in the lab. Looking back now the labs have been more difficult than the last.

* Lab 10

    part 2 was a favorite for me because it was interesting learning how you can write a code that looks up all of California's population data. I had no idea you can make code to store large amounts of data and input an answer and be given the correct answer.I would definitely do this again but with something similar.

* Lab 11

    part 2 was a favorite for me because I was interested to see how much work goes into coding a guess the secret number game. I was shocked to learn you have to write code for every aspect of the game or it might not run correctly. I have always been intrigued by how games are made it was cool to program a simple one like this
